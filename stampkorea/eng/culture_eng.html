                <h3>Etiquette</h3>
                <p>Why Should I Read A Guide To Korean Etiquette?
                    Korean culture has evolved very differently from many other countries in the West, and even other Asian countries.</p>
                <p>This guide to Korean etiquette is here to help you understand how to avoid making mistakes and cultural faux pas when visiting South Korea. Furthermore, it’ll hopefully open your eyes to the hidden, deeper elements of Korean culture.</p>
                <p>Top 3 Tips For Understanding Korean Culture To understand the rules for Korean etiquette, it is first necessary to understand some basic principles about Korean culture and how it is different from your own culture.
                </p>
                <p>These 3 points only touch the surface of Korean culture, but should give you a basic introduction into what makes Korea so unique.
                    If you’d like a deeper insight into living in Korea as an expat, and some of the challenges and benefits of Korean culture, then check out my guide to expat life in Korea.</p>

                    <h3>1: Group Harmony Vs. Individual Needs</h3>
                    <p>There is a lot to understand about Korean culture, a lot more than I can cover in this guide to Korean etiquette. A lot of public morals and values stem from the teachings of Confucius, who promoted harmony within society, compassion, and empathy above individual needs and wants.</p>
                    <p>The effect this has on society takes a long time to fully appreciate, but basically equates to Koreans putting others before themselves. I’m not saying this always happens, but it is shown most often in social situations, such as in restaurants. Similarly, people who disrupt the group harmony with their individual issues might be frowned upon. Hopefully this won’t be an issue when you travel to Korea, but it’s worth knowing anyway.</p>

                    <h3>2: Respect For Elders</h3>
                    <div class="img">
                        <img src="../img/respect.jpg" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>As with many cultures, respect goes upwards in age and older people are respected more than younger ones. Due to Confucian teachings that have been prevalent in Korean society for a long time, age is even more important than normal.</p>
                    <p>Age can dictate the way you act or behave to someone, who gets to get on the subway first, who eats at dinner first, and even who pays for meals when you’re out. You might be asked your age so that people can figure out where you fit in the hierarchy. Therefore, you shouldn’t be surprised if this question comes up a few times. Although modern Korean society is diminishing this hierarchy, perhaps for the worst in some cases, it is important to be aware of. Try to treat elders with respect in South Korea, as I hope most people would do anyway.</p>

                    <p>It’s understandable that you would be too excited focusing on the many delicious traditional Korean dishes to remember all the ways that you might break with Korean etiquette.</p>
                    <p>What may seem to be a simple activity – eating – can actually throw up so many opportunities for etiquette mistakes. However, with this simple guide to Korean etiquette for dining out, you can easily avoid any problems. For more information about Korean dining etiquette, as well as some essential Korean phrases for ordering food, be sure to check out this article: Here are some of the most important things to know when dining out:</p>

                <li class="nb4">
                    <h3>3-1.Korean Table Manner #1: Oldest Eats First</h3>
                    <p>Once you’re seated for dinner, it’s also common courtesy to let those older than you to begin eating first before you get started on enjoying your delicious meal. That’s why Koreans make an effort to ask your age early on — it gives them an idea of where you stand in situations like this, so they can interact with you without disrespecting you or making you uncomfortable. That way, they know how to treat you in these types of situations.</p>
                    
                </li>
                <li class="nb5">
                    <h3>3-2.Korean Table Manner #2: Tell That You Will Eat Well</h3>
                    <p>Before taking your first bite, it’s important to say that you will eat well, as a way of acknowledging that you are looking forward to the meal you are about to have. In Korean, this is expressed with the words Jalmeokgesseumnida (잘먹겠습니다), which in English would translate to ‘I will eat well’. This is a kind compliment to the chef, and it’s always nice to show gratitude! Sprinkle this phrase into your Korean dining experience and impress your host.

                </li>
                <li class="nb6">
                    <h3>3-3.Korean Table Manner #3: Match Eating Speed</h3>
                    <p>Try to manage eating at the same pace as those around you. If you notice that you are going to be finished with your food while everyone is still on their first few bits, you might want to slow it down. Trust me, we know how great food can be in Korea, but that doesn’t mean you have to finish it super quickly! That can make it look like you’re trying to rush the dinner and you’d rather not be there or you have somewhere else to be.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, if you’ve barely touched your food and everyone else is almost done, it’s time to chow down! If you eat too slowly, your host may think that you’re not enjoying the meal and you’re trying to put off each bite.</p>
                    <p>It may seem like a lot to think about, but I promise that once you’ve dined a couple of times in Korea it becomes second nature and it won’t take away from you enjoying your meal. Just stay aware of what other guests are doing and make sure you’re at a similar pace and it’ll become second nature!</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>3-4.Korean Table Manner #4: Alcoholic Drink Etiquette(★★★★★)</h3>
                    <p>Especially in the case of an alcoholic drink, pour drinks for others first, and let someone else pour yours! If you see an elder with an empty glass, try to fill it up as soon as possible as a common courtesy and a sign of respect. If your elders offer you a drink, unless there is an extreme reason why you cannot drink, don’t refuse it. Graciously accept and enjoy!</p>
                    <p>As for actual drink pouring etiquette, hold your cup with both hands when you have alcohol being poured into it to prevent the cup from being knocked over and spilling the liquid. Also, hold the bottle with both hands when it’s your turn to pour the alcohol to help ensure that you won’t spill anything on the table while you’re pouring. Alternatively, you can also place one of your hands under your pouring arm when pouring or lightly over your elbow if you are the one receiving the drink — both options are perfectly acceptable and respectful.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="nb7">
                    <h3>4 Shoes Are Not Always Allowed Inside</h3>
                    <p>Many restaurants in South Korea have traditional floor tables with no chairs. If you see a restaurant with a shoe rack by the entrance, then you should take your shoes off before you enter. The floor will usually be raised to indicate that shoes shouldn’t be worn, too</p>
                    <p>Sometimes there will be a mixture of dining options, with regular tables and chairs and then a raised section with a wooden floor and low tables. There is a barrier to indicate that you need to take your shoes off. If in doubt, point at your feet and make a ‘should-I-take-them-off?‘ gesture.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="nb8">
                    <h3>5: Wait For Elders To Eat Before You Do</h3>
                    <p>This applies if you’re having a formal dinner with Korean people, particularly in a business situation. As mentioned, age is very important in Korean society and the respectful thing to do is wait for the oldest member to start the dinner. This also applies to finishing your meal. However, this isn’t so important among friends.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="nb9">
                    <h3>6: Help Others Before You Help Yourself</h3>
                    <p>This applies to a couple of things.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, the cutlery (chopsticks and spoon) are usually kept in a drawer under the table, or in a box on the table. In Korea, it is expected that the person nearest the cutlery will pass it out to other people before themselves. It’s often best to place the spoon and chopsticks together on a paper napkin and pass it to the other person.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, when drinks arrive at the table, be sure to pour for other people first. Fill up other glasses before you get a drink, which leads on to the next point…</p>

                    <p>Essential Korean Phrases At A Restaurant</p>
                    <p>Korean restaurants come in all shapes and sizes, from open restaurants with tables spilling out onto the
                        pavement, to quiet retreats hidden inside a traditional hanok house. Whatever place you decide to dine at,
                        these easy Korean phrases for ordering food will help you get in the door and be ready to start thinking
                        about what to eat.</p>
                    <p>Ordering food in Korea can happen in a number of ways, depending on where you’re dining. The most common form
                        is the standard table service, where someone will come to your table and take your order. Don’t always
                        expect someone to come to you, however. Many times you’ll have to shout out ‘저기요!’ (joh-gi-yo) to get
                        served. In Korea you’ll have to be brave to be heard and if you don’t shout out, you can sometimes be left
                        waiting for ages. Joel’s Tip: Before you do shout out, be sure to check the table for a call button. It’s a
                        small round button that will call someone over to take your order (or second orders, etc.).</p>
                    <p>Besides table service, an increasing number of places have self-service machines where you can order food.
                        These are typically fast food places like McDonald’s or Subway, but also include gimbap restaurants and
                        other places with cheap, simple dishes.</p>
                    <p>In Korean restaurants it’s common to see a sign that says ‘셀프’ (sel-peu), which means ‘self‘. This is a
                        self-serve area where you can top up on side dishes, water, and other parts of your meal for free. In Korean
                        BBQ places this is where you’d get extra lettuce, kimchi, garlic, etc. Now, here are you first 10 easy
                        Korean phrases for ordering food in Korea.</p>

                    <p>It is the biggest holiday in Korea and the first day of the first lunar month (January 1st lunar month). The most representative food of New Year's Day is rice cake soup. New Year's customs There are many different kinds of dishes such as ancestral rites, Seobae, Seolbim, Deokdam, Munanbi, Seol painting, Bokjori hanging, Yakwang driving, Cheongcham, Yutnori, Neolttwigi, and hair burning. However, these games are gradually disappearing as times change.</p>

                    <p>It has been said that it is the most vigorous day of the year, and it has continued to be a day where people of all ages and all ages change into new clothes and have fun. Dano also appears in the literature of the Han Dynasty of China, where from the old days, May is a rainy season, and it is said that many superstitious customs have been created as a precautionary measure, given that bad diseases are likely to be prevalent and that various fluids must be removed. In particular, this day is very meaningful for our ancestors who considered farming as the basis of their lives, as it is also a ritual for farmers to finish planting rice and pray for a good harvest. I also enjoyed a variety of games such as swing, wrestling, mask dance, lion dance, and mask play. It is also called Children's Day, and it is also a day when parents give gifts to children under the age of 13.</p>
